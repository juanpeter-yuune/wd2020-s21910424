                What is User Interface Design?
                User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, 
                focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. 
                UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other formsâ€”e.g., voice-controlled interfaces.

                What is User Experience (UX) Design?
                User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful 
                and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring 
                and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

                What is Design System ?
                Design System is much more than UI Style-guide. It is a source of truth for the whole team. 
                This means UI Component Library for Designers, Ready to use UI Elements in a code for Developers 
                and the Principles described in the documentation. Design System helps you maintain consistency and design faster. It helps to communicate with the rest of the team.
